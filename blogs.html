                <h2>Stav Scented Wax Candles were created by my friend, Taylor, and I.</h2>
                <div class="work-experience">

                  <p>
                    I met Taylor my freshman year of college in an economics class. We
                    were both athletes and accounting majors with a shared dream of one day building a business.
                    I have always had an entrepreneurial spirit, but until late 2020 I
                    was unsure what I wanted to do with it. Taylor and I had tossed around
                    the idea of starting a business together, but with school and work
                    we never felt like it was the right time.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Taylor and I both currently both work at CPA firms in Tyler, Texas,
                    and although we like our jobs...we needed more. In addition
                    to our interests in sports and business, we both also love
                    candles (what girl doesn’t?). We were working on homework
                    one night talking about how we couldn’t wait
                    to not be working and going to school simultaneously. Somehow
                    we also got onto the idea of starting on own business so we
                    wouldn’t have to continue going to work for someone else at
                    all. This first started off as somewhat of a joke, but then
                    we both started truly considering the idea of starting our
                    own business. We know the financial aspect of how companies
                    work, we had the people skills needed to garner business and
                    market our company, the only thing we were missing was our
                    product. Luckily, it didn’t take us too long to come to a
                    conclusion for this either.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    We easily both thought of creating our own candles because
                    this is shared obsession of ours. We immediately began considering
                    vendors and researching how candles are made. The biggest
                    obstacle we faced in the beginning was picking a name for
                    our company, and opening our joint bank account.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    When we decided that we were truly serious about taking
                    this on, in addition to our jobs and school, we were not going
                    to let anything stop us (including the first few candles we
                    made that were a complete disaster). We found our vendors,
                    made a few prototypes, created our LLC, and started our business.
                    Unfortunately, the candle business is a tough industry to
                    jump into. We knew we had to differentiate our product if
                    we wanted any chance at being competitive.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    We did some research and as it turns out, some candles on
                    the market are kind of toxic! We found stories of people going into
                    ERs with bloody noses and migraines that were relentless.
                    The articles came to the conclusion that candles were the
                    causes of these issues. When we landed on this realization,
                    we knew candles made from soy wax (the healthy alternative
                    for burning wax) was our sell point.
                  </p>
                  <p>To be frank, making our first few candles was not fun… at
                    all. We were not putting the correct amount of essential oils,
                    our wax was burning/drying uneven, and we couldn’t get the
                    wick to stay in place to save our lives. However, we learned,
                    adapted, and grew from all of these failures. We laughed,
                    complained, second guessed ourselves, and kept going.
                    Eventually, we figured it out (13 candles later).
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    When we began distributing our products, we only sold to our
                    friends and family. We had to make sure what we were selling
                    was worth buying. We told people what they should expect and
                    we priced our candles based on their worth. We had to ask
                    ourselves, "how much would we pay for this candle?". We asked our
                    first few customers for feedback and gave them a survery to
                    fill out. We valued our customers feedback and changed our process
                    of making the candles based on their opinions and suggestions.
                    We took polls on our instagram account asking our customers
                    what kind of scents they would prefer and what kind of labels
                    would appeal to them.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    We are still in the early stages of our business, but we're continuing
                    to promote and advertise our products via social media. We have been
                    diligent about keeping our overhead costs to a minimum and
                    not accumulating too much inventory. We still have a long
                    way to go, but we are figuring it out. When the time is right,
                    we will look into moving our product onto Etsy and growing
                    our business that way too!
