                <h2>Stav Scented Wax Candles were created by my friend, Taylor, and I.</h2>
                <div class="work-experience">

                  <p>We met freshman year of college in our economics class. We were both athletes, accounting majors, and wanted to be in charge of anything we were a part of. I have always had an entrepreneurial spirit, but I was unsure what I wanted to do with it until November 2020. </p>
                  <p>Taylor and I both currently both work at CPA firms in Tyler, Texas, and although we like our jobs…. We needed more. In addition to our interests in sports and business, we both also love candles (what girl doesn’t?). We were working on homework one night talking (complaining) about how we couldn’t wait to not be working and going to school simultaneously. Somehow we also got onto the idea of starting on own business so we wouldn’t have to continue going to work for someone else at all. This first started off as somewhat of a joke, but then we both started truly considering the idea of starting our own business. We know the financial aspect of how companies work, we had the people skills needed to garner business and market our company, the only thing we were missing was our product. Luckily, it didn’t take us too long to come to a conclusion for this either.</p>
                  <p>We easily both thought of creating our own candles because this is shared obsession of ours. We immediately began considering vendors and researching how candles are made. The biggest obstacle we faced in the beginning was picking a name for our company since every name we liked somehow managed to already be in use by another company. </p>
                  <p>When we decided that we were truly serious about taking this on in addition to our jobs and school, we were not going to let anything stop us (including the first few candles we made that were a complete disaster). We found our vendors, made a few prototypes, got our DBA, and started our business. Unfortunately, the candle business is a tough industry to jump into. We knew we had to differentiate our product if we wanted any chance at making it.</p>
                  <p>We did some research and as it turns out, some candles on the market are TOXIC! We found stories of people going into ERs with bloody noses and migraines that were relentless. The articles came to the conclusion that candles were the causes of these issues. When we landed on this realization, we knew candles made from 100% soy wax (the healthy alternative for burning wax) was our sell point.</p>
                  <p>To be frank, making our first few candles was not fun… at all. We were not putting the correct amount of essential oils, our wax was burning/drying uneven, and we couldn’t get the wick to stay in place to save our lives. However, we learned, adapted, and grew from all of these failures. We laughed, complained, second guessed ourselves, and kept going. Eventually, we figured it out (13 candles later).</p>
                  <p>When we began selling our products, we only sold to our friends and family. We had to make sure what we were selling was worth buying. We told people what they should expect and we priced our candles based on their worth. We had to ask ourselves, "how much would we pay for this candle?". We asked our first few customers for feedback and gave them a survery to fill out. We valued our customers feedback and changed our process of making the candles based on their opinions and suggestions. We took polls on our instagram account asking our customers what kind of scents they would prefer and what kind of labels would appeal to them.</p>
                  <p>We then made our Instagram account, and continue to promote and advertise our products via social media. We have been diligent about keeping our overhead costs to a minimum and not accumulating too much inventory. We still have a long way to go, but we are figuring it out. When the time is right, we will look into moving our product onto Etsy and growing our business that way too!</p>
