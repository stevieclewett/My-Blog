                <h2>This blog post is not intended to talk about my regret of choosing accounting as a major but...</h2>
                <div class="work-experience">

                  <p>I’m 99% sure that if Professor Reynolds had not been my professor,I would not have graduated as
                    an accounting major. I’m not sure what I would have done though...maybe teaching or management?
                    Now don’t get me wrong, I, in no way, regret my decision to go into accounting. It is a valuable
                    skill set to have and I have already seen the benefits of majoring in accounting.
                    The part of accounting I struggle with most is the lack of human interaction I get. I know
                    some accountants have the luxury of working with/getting new clients but I haven’t been able to see
                    that side of accounting yet.</p>
                  <p>If I could go back and change my decision to major in accounting, would I? Not a chance. I tell
                    myself that I worked too hard for this damn degree and I am SO close to finishing my masters, so
                    I can’t be regretful of any decisions I have made that got me to where I am now. I know at the end
                    of the day, those degrees mean something. I also do my best to remember how fortunate I am to have
                    the opportunity to be getting my masters degree in accounting. There are so many people who would
                    kill to have the opportunities that I have right now in my life. So for that, I am incredibly grateful.</p>
                  <p>I also appreciate being able to read a financial statements and have an understanding of how most
                    companies operate from an internal perspective. I have the knowledge and skills of an accountant
                    (which is awesome), but not the personality. For this reason, I feel stuck. I think
                    what I am missing from my current job though is the face to face interactions and meeting new people.
                    I will say though, I have been extremely lucky to work where I do now and start my professional career
                    off in such a positive way. The partners, managers, and coworkers I work with now are truly good people.
                    I know that everyone I work with genuinely wants the best for me, even if that means I have to leave
                    Tyler to work somewhere else.</p>
                  <p>I am looking for a job that will allow me to use my accounting degree, or business knowledge in
                    general. Honestly though, I don’t really know what that looks like yet. I have been searching for new
                    jobs and I think I have an idea of what I would like to do, but I also think that no one really knows
                    what they want to do until they have actually tried it.</p>
                  <p>So for now, I am keeping my options open and prayers up until I find where I am supposed to be. </p>
