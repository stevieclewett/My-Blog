                <h2>Although I love my candles, my first love was DIY projects.</h2>
                <div class="work-experience">

                  <p>In my senior year of college, I really started to pursue the things that bring me joy. I realized
                    how much I like art,interior design, and seeing something new in something broken.</p>
                  <p>My obsession began while scrolling through the pages of Pinterest and walking the aisles at Goodwill.
                    I would see furniture and decor pieces that I loved and wanted for myself, but I couldn't afford because
                    they were too expensive. Of course in college, I was not earning a real income yet and couldn't afford much.
                    Thus, I started creating my DIY (Do It Yourself) projects because I had to find affordable ways to
                    recreate decor elements I wanted for my own home!</p>
                  <p>I started buying old pieces of furniture online at Facebook market and Goodwill, re-doing them,
                    and selling them at a markup. This is what I was doing in my spare time when I wasn't at the golf course
                    or in class. I love being outside, the hands-on aspect of my projects, and seeing something come to life. I also love
                    thrift shopping too just to see how creative I can be!</p>
                  <p>Now don't get me wrong, there was quite a bit of trial and error during my projects. This one time,
                    I found two barstools that I wanted to re-do. Unfortunately, I decided to just paint over the chair
                    that had wood stain on it... the stain just kept bleeding through the paint. That was when I learned
                    how to properly remove wood stain and how to sand something down to its original state.</p>
                  <p>Selling my DIY projects was the first time I was selling something that had my name on it. I was
                    meeting new people through Facebook market trying to sell them on something I created, and I think
                    I did a pretty good job of it!</p>
                    <p>I was always very honest with all of my customers, and I think they really valued my transparency with
                    all of the projects I completed. I would communicate with them to see what kind of pieces they
                    were looking for or needing, and if I thought I could create something that could be of use to them.
                    Most importantly, I would always make them aware of any imperfections in my work. I did not
                    send someone home with something without them knowing exactly what to expect. I kept myself honest throughout
                    this process by asking myself, "would I pay for this?". In doing this, I never once had anyone complain
                    or try to send me something back because they always knew what they were paying for. That is my biggest
                    take away from my DIY projects.</p>
                  <p>None of my projects ever took me too long either and I enjoyed every second of it!
                    My DIY projects have slowed down a bit since I graduated and started working.
                    I have started to focus more on work, school, and my candle business. That is not to say I'm done with DIY
                    projects completely, I'm just taking a break for now (:</p>
