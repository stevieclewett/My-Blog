                <div class="work-experience">

                  <p>My senior year of college, I really started becoming my own person. I realized how much I like art, interior design, and seeing something new in something broken.</p>
                  <p>I think my obsession began on Facebook market. I am pretty sure I was looking for a tv stand for my apartment and I couldn't find anything I liked, so I decided to just make it myself (somewhat). I found a cheap tv stand, took the legs off, gave it a fresh coat of paint, and became addicted to DIYs.</p>
                  <p>I started buying old pieces of furniture online and at Goodwill, re-doing them, and selling them at a markup. This is what I was doing in my spare time when I wasn't at the golf course or in class. I love being outside, the hands on labor, and seeing something come to life. I also love thrift shopping too just to see how creative I can be!</p>
                  <p>Now don't get me wrong, there was quite a bit of trial and error during my projects. This one time, I found two barstools that I wanted to re-do. Unfortunately, I decided to just paint over the chair that had wood stain on it... the stain just kept bleeding through the paint. That was when I learned how to remove wood stain and how to sand something down to the natural wood.</p>
                  <p>Selling my DIY projects was the first time I was selling something that had my name on it. I was meeting new people trying to sell them on something I created, and I think I did a pretty good job of it. I was always very honest with all of my customers, and I think they really valued my transparency with all of the pieces I had re-done and sold. I would communicate with them to see what kind of pieces they were looking for or needing, and if I thought I had something that could be of use to them, I would let them know. I would also tell them if what I had was probably not something they would be interested in. Most importantly, I would always make them aware of any imperfections in my work. I did not send someone home with something without them knowing exactly what to expect. I kept myself honest throughout this whole process by asking myself, "would I pay for this?". In doing this, I never once had anyone complain or try to send me something back because they always knew what they were paying for. That is my biggest take away from my DIY projects.</p>
                  <p>The best part of all of this though was the extra money I was making from it! I would buy something for cheap, refinish it, and sell it at a profit. None of my projects ever took me too long either and I enjoyed every second of it. My DIY projects have slowed down a bit since I graduated and started working. I have started to focus more on work, school, and my candle business. That is not to say I'm done with DIY projects completely, I'm just taking a break for now (:</p>
